					<h3>What is VMR (Verified Movie Ratings)?</h3>
					<p>A Verified Movie Rating is an audience rating (or user review) about an upcoming movie that has been
						authenticated by Gofobo and our affiliates. With our patented technology, we are able to verify and confirm
						that an <span>audience member has seen the actual movie during an advance movie screening.</span></p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Unlike other movie websites, we verify users that have actually attended a movie screening (or event) by
						scannning their tickets with our <span>patented technology before collecting their feedback and experience</span>.</p>

					<h3>Flowchart</h3>
					<p>
						This project is a sub-project of gofobo.com redesign. Gofobo is a movie screening website that audiences can
						find all kinds of latest movies’ information they need. VMR (Verified Movie Rating) feature is one of the
						significant part in this website. The old version of gofobo.com has outdated and user unfriendly design. Our
						team was assigned to redesign the whole website and VMR page, as one of the most visited page, was the
						priority. We can see from the this flowchart that redesigning this website is a huge project, so we divided into
						several groups.<span> We are responsible for the VMR features</span>.</p>

					<h3>Sketch on paper based on original contents</h3>
					<p>
						Since this is a redesign project, we want to keep the same contents in the old version website. But we try to
						redesign the layout of each elements, as well as styles in order to make the interfaces looks better. <span>The
							old
							version interfaces are too misleading based on feedbacks from many users.</span> After our analysis, we found
						out
						that we should divided different kinds of contents into sections, and combine the corresponding contents
						together. We discussed during the meetings about how should be replace the layouts of the new pages, and
						we draw some sketches on paper to have a basic ideas of how we should do on next steps.</p>

					<h3>Mockup for Web and responding pages for phone screens</h3>
					<p>
						After finishing the wireframes, we started to designing the mockups. Since we had a previews UI kits for gofobo
						design. Even though we need huge change for the interfaces, we still try to keep the basic styles the same.
						For example, the fonts, and color schemes. However, we still made many changes of the styles. We made
						background color from white to black. This is inspired by many movie websites like Netflix. We believed black
						background make users feel they are in the movie theater. Also, it is easy emphasize the movie posters by
						using contrast. At the same time,<span> we try to use blur and shadow to make the interface more
							three-dimensional.</span>
						After finishing the first version of mockup, we are ready for the comments and next changes.</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/VMR%20images/9.png" width="100%"  >
					</div>
					<p  >
						We also design a different version of interfaces for phone size. In order to make the pages easy for users to
						contents that
						show in one screen. Also, we add some menu bar for different contents in order to make users have easier
						access.

					<h3>Feedbacks & Changes</h3>
					<p>
						We sent our mockup pages to our leader for feedbacks. Overall, we did good job, but there are still some
						details that we need to pay attention to. Andrew points out several places that we still need to work on, like
						the Header part in the home page. The movie poster and the information of movie seems a little bit odd. <span>We
							believed that it is because the contents are too much and we did not make a good layout.</span> Also, we need to
						add sections on the home page for license reading and learn more. We also need to design those two parts
						in order to let users make sense of what they are doing. After reviewing all the feedbacks and requirements,
						we started to edit our designs.</p>

					<p>This is a challenging but interesting project. During the internship, I got a lot of helps from others. Since
						this is
						a redesign project, we should think carefully before making every changes. We don’t want to make a worse
						design then old version. This project did not involved too complex user flows and logics. However, it is still
						very
						challenging since there are so many different contents we should present to users. It is easy to put everything
						on the website, but it is difficult to use design to present a comfortable user experiences for every visitors of
						our
						website.<span> We did so many iteration of some small details, and I think this is worthy.</span> If you compare
						the first
						version of mockup to our finalized design, you can see there are huge differences and huge improvements.</p>
						<br/>
					<p>
						However, we did not have chances for real user testing.<span> We did test our products, but we did not get large
							numbers of users.</span> The feedbacks we got are basically the problems team leaders found. So if there are
						opportunities for more user testing in the future, we should definitely get better design.</p>
