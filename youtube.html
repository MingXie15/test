					<h3>Why Youtube needs redesign?</h3>
					<p>
						Youtube is one of the most popular video applications in the world. As a youtube user,<span> I spend at least 2
							hours
							on Youtube everyday</span>. As a result, I am very familiar with this app. To be honest, the design of Youtube
						is outstanding. By using youtube, you can feel that designers really care about user experiences, and they pay
						attention to details. <span>However, nothing is perfect</span>. Through my experiences of using, I found out
						several places
						that could be improved. So I decided to found out all the problems still appears on youtube, and try to solve
						these problems by redesigning a new version of youtube.</p>

				<div class="problemFinding-content-1">
					<h3>What we found based on our own experiences</h3>
					<p>
						First of all, we started to list out several problems that <span>we found based on our experiences of using
							Youtube</span>.
						Since we are both long-time Youtube users, so we believed that our feedbacks can also be seem as valuable.
						We listed several uncomfortable experiences during our use. For example, hard to make some control when
						we use single hand and lie on the bed. Comment area is hard to access. More button for video can be neglect
						easily. <span>However, these findings are only based on our own assumption</span>. We can not make sure that
						these
						problems are really necessary to solve. So we did some obeservation and interviews to prove our findings are
						correct. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="problemFinding-content-2">
					<h3>Interesting fact about single hand control</h3>
					<p>
						We found out there are many buttons on youtube that are in some conner places that are hard to control. As
						the phone screen become bigger and bigger, there are serious problems that we, as an UX designer, need to
						think about. Not only the screen become bigger, I found out that most of people like to use one hand to
						control the phone. I searched online and saw the <span>portion of people like to use single hand is 50%</span>.
						Like the
						image below indicate. When using single hand to control your phone, there are certainly some areas that you
						may feel uncomfortable. If your are a girl with small hand, this problem become more seriously. I found out the
						image to show the areas of screen that you may feel uncomfortable. We can see the images below, there are
						high percentages of people like to use single hand, and when you use single hand to control your phone, there
						are some comfortable zones and uncomfortable zones. <span>So, when we do the observation, we want to focus
							on this issue</span>.</p>

					<h3>Observation & Interview</h3>
					<p>
						In order to make sure the problems we found is worth solving, and understand the habits of using Youtube in
						the aspect of single hand control, we found 10 people in UCSD and observe them using Youtube. During
						using, <span>we asked them to make some actions</span>, for example, watch a video and control the progress bar.
						We also had some <span>short interviews with them talking about their experiences of using Youtube</span>. For
						example, when they usually use Youtube? Do they watch Youtube video before sleep? What position do they
						usually use Youtube? Based on these observations and interviews, we found out some main issues that we
						should deal with.</p>

				<div class="problemFinding-content-4">
					<h3>Problems & Solution</h3>
					<p>
						After observations and interviews, we make some analysis of the results we collected. Based on these data,
						we combined some of these findings and listed out <span>several major problems that needed to be solve</span>.
						Then,
						we discuss the solutions based on these problems.</p>

					<h3>Re-Organize User Flow</h3>
					<p>
						Many interviewers say that they sometimes feel confusing when there are so many options on home page, and
						this is not a good feeling. By drawing the sitemap of home page of youtube, you found the reasons. As you can
						see, <span>the structure of youtube is relatively shallow</span>. So users don’t need to make too much steps to
						find out
						one page. But the disadvantage is that there are too many options on single page. So we decided to
						<span>re-organized the structures of youtube by combining several options into one category</span>. At the same
						time,
						we don’t want to combine too much elements. Since too many steps for users can also get confused.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="design-content-2">
					<h3>Single-hand control concerned</h3>
					<p>
						According to our analysis based on observation, We try to design the interface that avoid user to control the
						phone in unnatural areas. <span>The idea is to move some buttons to more comfortable places, or use other
							gesture instead of touch</span>. In this way they can control on any place on the phone screen. What’s more, we
						try to create a left hand and right hand mode, which you can place the significant buttons to the most
						comfortable area based on right hand or left hand control.</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/youtube%20images/9@2x.png" width="100%">

				</div>
				<div class="design-content-3">
					<h3>Move Comments area</h3>
					<p>
						Through using youtube, we found out <span>it is little bit bothering when you want to read comments</span>. Since
						you
						need to scroll the pages to the bottom, go through all the movie informations, recommend videos. And
						interviewee’s feedbacks supported our idea. So we try to move the comments area to the top.</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/youtube%20images/10@2x.png" >
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="design-content-4">
					<h3>Designing Style</h3>
					<p>
						Some interviewers say that the layouts for some pages are messy. We believe this is not only the problems of
						contents, but also the designing styles. So <span>we try to combine the advantages of Material Design and IOS
							Design</span>, to make a new version of styles for youtube. The most significant idea for MD is to use shadow to
						create
						layers. This is useful for divide sections. However, the font size and some details designs are not good enough
						for MD. These problems can be solved by applying IOS Design. The latest version of IOS Design uses bold and
						big fonts for navigation. I think this is a very good idea since <span>it is easy for users to read, at the same
							time
							keep the interface clean</span>. What’s more, the round angle IOS design uses is more comfortable on visual
						aspect.
						So I combined these advantages together to create a new style for youtube.</p>

				<div class="design-content-6">
					<h3>Left / Right Mode for watching video</h3>
					<p>
						The most significant change for this project is to add left/right mode for watching videos. Image the situation
						when you are watching videos on youtube by single hand like the image on the right. It is usually uncomfortable
						to control the phone, especially for progress bar, since the screen is too wide. So we add a button to switch to
						the interface based on different using hands. And we move the progress bar to the left/right side, in this way
						users can easily reach this progress bar. This is actually a bold attempt, since we don’t see any other similar
						design in other video players. We want to give it a try to see whether users love it.</p>

				<div class="design-content-7">
					<h3>User Testing & Changes</h3>
					<p>
						After finishing the prototype, we invited some people to test our product. We asked them to do some actions on
						<span>both the current Youtube app and our prototype</span>. These actions involve the changes that we made.
						After
						testing, we asked them several questions based on their experiences. Fortunately, most of our changes have
						positive responses, <span>especially the left/right hand mode</span>. However, there are still some problems on
						our
						changes. For example, users like the old design for the “more actions”, since the space for those options are
						bigger, and they are on the bottom of the page, so they are easy to touch.<span> Also, they don’t like the places
							we
							put the button to change categories</span>. Since they always touch these button by accident, and it is
						annoying. So
						we move the buttons to the left.</p>

				<div class="conclusion-content-1">
					<p>
						This is an interesting experience of design. There are many challenges that we faced. But fortunately, we found
						out the solutions. The most important thing we learned is to think about using scenarios when making designs.
						For example, the new design for watching videos, we came up with this idea by thinking about the scenarios
						when people use single hand to watch video. Also, we learned that layouts for a page is not only about beauty,
						but also the usability. We should take the comfort level of making a specific action into account.
					</p>
					<p>However, we still need more user testing to help me understand what I need to improve. Right now we can
						only asked several students to test our designs and receive feedbacks. Even though we can have some
						valuable feedbacks, we still need huge number of testing for most correct results. Hope we can find the
						opportunity to have more feedbacks.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="conclusion-content-2">
					<h3>Remaining Issues & Future Change</h3>
					<p>
						Even though our prototype seems satisfying for users, there are still some possible issues that we have not
						thought about or dealt with. Since we made many innovative changes on some significant features, for
						example, video playing interface. So there may be some aspects of design that will be affected by our new
						design. As a result, we still need more consideration on our decisions and maybe more user testing in the
						future.</p>
