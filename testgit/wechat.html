					<h3>Why WeChat?</h3>
					<p>WeChat is one of the most popular social medias in China. Released in 2011 by Tencent, it has over 1
						billion monthly active users now (Wikipedia). People can not only have instant communication with friends by
						using messages, voice calls and video calls, but also share picture, videos and links in WeChat. What’s more,
						WeChat have some extra functions including payment, gaming and media posting. We can describe WeChat
						as the combination of Facebook and Instagram. WeChat is popular not only because its rich functions, but
						also the outstanding user experiences. <span>Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe once said, “Devils in the details”</span>.
						What
						he meant is that detail is the key for good designs. WeChat does amazing jobs focusing on details. In this paper,
						I explore what aspects of WeChat’s design contribute to its interfaces being so user-friendly.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Well-known user experience designer Jesse James Garrett in his book “The Element of User Experiences”
						points out <span>five planes for user experiences, which are “The Strategy Plane, The Scope Plane, The
							Structure Plane, The Skeleton Plane and The Surface Plane” (Garrett)</span>. The Strategy Plane and The Scope
						Plane focus on problem findings and user demands. The Structure Plane serves as working flows for products.
						In my analysis of WeChat, I put my concentration on The Skeleton Plane and The Surface Plane which
						represent more on interface design, info design and visual design to see how these two elements can have
						significant effects on user experiences, since these two planes can represent the most straight forward feelings
						of user’s experiences. Based on my observation and experiences of using, I summarized four major parts that
						<span>WeChat is doing well in interfaces and visual designs, including User psychology analysis, Color
							choices, Strategies for simplify and Comfortableness of control</span>.

				<h1 class="overview-title">User Psychology</h1>
				<hr class="overview-hr">
				<div class="userPsychology-content-1">
					<p>
						Through WeChat’s designs, we can see design team cares about user’s psychology when users are using this
						product. By analyzing what users are thinking when they use WeChat, <span>designers modified their designs to
							please users</span>. For example, WeChat’s logo (Figure1) is the combination of two message icons. Two icons
						overlay with each making the feelings of relying on each others. While when you click into the app, the first
						interface (Figure2) you see is one person standing in front of a big earth. This design goal seems to makes
						people feel lonely and tiny. Why is such a big contrast? Try to image the situation when users are using WeChat:
						people feel boring and they want to find someone to chat. They first see the logo and feels reliable. After that
						they see the one-person image. <span>At this moment, people’s feelings of lonely can be re-triggered and
							magnify</span>. So when they finally enter the chatting pages, they reach their max desires of chatting.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/WeChat%20images/2.png" width="100%">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="userPsychology-content-2">
					<p>
						There is another example show how WeChat’s design team pay attention to user’s mind. Let’s see the
						“Moment” section (Figure 6). Moment is one of the most popular functions in WeChat. It is just like the functions
						of Facebook and Instagram, users can share photos, videos or links. This part is the key of social media.
						However, Moment is not one of the four main categories of WeChat.<span> When you want to go to Moment, you
							should first go to Explore, then the first option is Moment</span>.
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/WeChat%20images/3.png">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="userPsychology-content-3">
					<p>
						It is often suggested that Moment should be put at the bottom in order to emphasize its importance. This seems
						reasonable since the social media component is an important part of WeChat, and therefore Moment should be
						one of the four main categories. But WeChat’s design team still makes Moment as just one option in Explore.
						Why? in the book “Methods of Tencent’s Products” points out that “Environment and atmosphere have great
						impact on human’s sub-consciousness” (Li). <span>For example, if you are in a coffee shop, the smell of coffee
							bean and the soft music can make you feel relax, and as a result express yourself comfortably. While
							when you are in a conference room, you may feel stressed and cautious about what you want to say</span>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						It seems that the purpose of placing Moment in a different part of the app is because it’s use is intended to be
						at
						a different tempo. Like Li says, “Good product can distinguish different sections’ atmosphere, and correlate
						these differences with user’s sub-consciousness” (Li). When you are in the chatting page, you can have instant
						communication with others. So this page represents real-time and efficiency. In other words, the tempo of the
						chatting page is very fast. While in Moment, the tempo is slow. Users read their friends’ posts, perhaps in the
						mean
						time thinking about sharing something with themselves. It seems as though the designers intended for Moment
						to be a private space, separate from the noisy chatting space. The goals seems to be to allow users to choose
						whether they want to leave the noisy place, go through a hall, and open the door of their private space.<span>
							The
							“extra click” is just like the hall and door. If there are no hall and door, users will have pressures on
							cognition</span>, and as a result feel confused. This small detail push WeChat’s user experiences to the next
						level.
						Through two examples above, we can see how significant changes you can make when you focus on user’s mind.

			<div class="colorChoice" id="colorChoice">
				<h1 class="overview-title">Color Choice</h1>
				<hr class="overview-hr">
				<div class="colorChoice-content-1">
					<p>
						<span>Color is the soul for an app</span>. Designers are very careful about WeChat’s color choices. They use
						green as
						the base color. Green has the feelings of expedite, rapid as well as vivid (Sen Qi). All of these features are
						suitable for social media. We can see many chatting apps use the same color like some other message tools
						including iPhone’s messages (Figure4) and Line (Figure3).
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/WeChat%20images/4.png" width="90%">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="colorChoice-content-2">
					<p>
						Even though green is the key, we can see from the interfaces (Figure5) that white is the main color for the
						interfaces. For example, the messages page (Figure5A), there are no unnecessary colors but only white and
						light gray. Designers use white for current panel while light gray is used to separate different layers. This
						design idea is applied by most of apps today. By using similar but distinguishable colors to create a sense of
						depth. According to Sen Qi, these color choices make interfaces clean and efficiently reduce users’ cognitive
						works.

				<div class="strategies-content-1">
					<p>
						Doing subtraction is also significant for design. It is important to provide as less options as possible to
						users.
						Barry Schwartz made an experiments to show that “when people have more choices, they can have less
						happiness” (Schwartz). He provides 6 and 24 different jam to two groups of participants. When the choices
						are 6, there are 30% of people buy they jam. When the choices are 24, the possibility decrease to only 3%.
						Li Li also claims that “In product design, multiple choices means disaster to users” (Li). Doing subtraction for
						user can reduce user’s costs of time and action, which is significant to attract users. Let’s see how WeChat
						do.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						When user want to post something to Moment (Figure7), there is a posting button that only has one option –
						posting pictures. However, there are also many forms of posting, like music, links and words. So how is
						subtraction built into the design? Take for example the situation when users want to post something. When
						they want to post a song, an article’s link, it is the time when they are actually listening to that music, or
						reading that article. So it is not logical when you press posting button, then search the music or articles. It
						is
						more reasonable that you listen to the music or read the articles, and you think they are good, then you
						share them. As a result, designers remove these two options from the posting button. For posting words,
						WeChat use the different gesture: press and hold. By using different gesture, user can divide different types
						of posing. As a result, we can see just a straight forward camera button for posting.

					<p>
						The ultimate goal for an app is to be used by people. So it is important that people use the app comfortably.
						Designing products which will not confuse users when they are using them is the duty of a good designer.
						Sachin Rekhi in his book “Don Norman’s Principles of Interaction Design” says that “Constraint is about
						limiting the range of interaction possibilities for the user to simplify the interface and guide the user to the
						appropriate next action.” One simple example is the car. The accelerator and the brake are both on the right.
						So the driver either steps on the accelerator or brake. This mutual exclusive design prevents drivers from
						making mistakes. This principle of constraints is also apparent in the design of WeChat. When you are
						sending voice message (Figure8) to others, you press and hold the button to record. After you finish speaking,
						you release the button. This is in contrast to another option the designers could have used: users press the
						button to record, and then they press again to stop recording. What’s the differences?<span> “Press” and
							“release”
							are mutual exclusive, while “press” and “press again” are not</span>. This prevents two identical gestures from
						being used for different functions. If this were the case, users could easily confuse whether they are recording
						or stopping. By using the gesture of press and hold, the user is spared his confusion.

				<div class="comfortableness-content-2">
					<p>
						WeChat cares about how comfortable it is for a user to operate their app. For example, the article “How Size
						of Screen Affect User Experiences” points out that <span>49% of users prefer to use single a hand to control
							their
							phones (Chen)</span>. We can see he comfort zone of iPhone from the picture below. (Figure9)
					</p>
					<div class="text-center">
						<img src="img/WeChat%20images/8.png">
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="comfortableness-content-3">
					<p>
						WeChat’s interfaces carefully follows these comfort zones in order to make the app comfortable for users to
						control. For example, four main categories are on the bottom (Figure10A). The alphabet orders of contact list
						are on the right side of the screen. (Figure10BC) All these designs make user easy to reach.<span> WeChat tends
							to put the most used button to the most comfortable places.</span>

					<p>
						Through all the examples I showed above, we can see how WeChat makes outstanding designs by focusing
						on User psychology analysis, Color choices, Strategies for simplify and Comfortableness of control. As the
						most popular social media in China, <span>WeChat shows us how to working on details in order to provide
							amazing user experience.</span> From 2011 to now, WeChat has developed many other functions. However, it
						always follows the user-centered idea, and that’s why it still keeps the clean style. As an UX designer, we
						should learn from WeChat’s idea of design.
